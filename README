HaxCC, a hacker's compiler for the MS-DOS/Windows target.

I will change the name when this compiler is more developed,
and when I have a better name.

This compiler is intended to work alongside existing
components, and to compile part of a program that needs it.
It will probably not generate whole programs for a long time.

External tools to use with it are:
 - Any external C preprocessor
 - NASM or YASM (assemblers)
 - Watcom linker
